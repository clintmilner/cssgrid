            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a US born, UK based Web Developer specializing in building Front End functionality for
                web sites and applications. I have worked in this field since 2008 and built web sites for
                light, medium, and heavy traffic sites, as well as greenfield software solutions.</p>
            <p>My past experience has included working on small teams that have grown into large ones, as
                well as working independently on employer projects and freelance client work.</p>
            <p>Currently I am the Head of Software Development managing a small team of software developers
                building products in the Network Security space. I am 100% hands-on, and am responsible for
                100% of the Front End code, but also have responsibilities in both the Full Stack, and Management worlds.</p>

        <h2>About My Site</h2>
        <p>Ideas &amp; concepts were first sketched on paper, but most of the designing took place in the browser; experimenting with ideas, colors, and imagery. Once HTML and CSS was written, I transferred assets to an installation of <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/'>Gatsby.js</a> . HTML was converted to <a href='https://reactjs.org/'>React.js</a> components, and CSS was optimized with <a href='https://sass-lang.com/'>Sass</a>.</p>
        <p>Gatsby transpiles &amp; converts all the React Components, ES6/ES7, and Sass into <strong>static</strong> assets which are then deployed to a server.</p>
        <p>Media assets are being served by <a href='https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/haec30sllfywfdtxculk'>Cloudinary.com</a> which offer a great on-the-fly optimization service for images and video.</p>
        <p>The site is hosted at <a href='https://www.netlify.com'>Netlify.com</a> which has Continuous Integration built in every time code is committed.</p>
